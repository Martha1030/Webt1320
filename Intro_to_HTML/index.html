  <p>I have 3 cats at my home. Their names are Holmes, Luna and Ozzy. Ozzy is the newest one and he is just a black kitten. Luna is actually my cat and she has this beaitful dark grey color. Holmes is obese and a dark orange color and he is my mom's cat. When I move out I wish to have 3 or 4 cats of my own including Luna. </p>
 
  <p>I also love the Harry Potter movies and the Captain America movies. I actually have a pretty neat Harry Potter tattoo on my left forearm and I plan to expand. I have seen those movies and read the books more times than I can remember. I also use the Captain America movies as comfort movies so I know for a fact I have seen those plenty of times. Bucky Barnes is my favorie character in the Marvel movies and Neville is my favorite chracter in the Harry Potter series.</p>
