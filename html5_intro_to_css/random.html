    <h2>Produce Department</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I began working for Food City in November of 2021. I started in the produce department cutting fruits and vegetables into trays and bowls for sale. I loved it and I love working for the company. It was simple and allowed me to be a bit creative with designs I can make and it taught me a lot about good and bad produce. I did not know much about produce since I do not eat a lot of it, so this is a great learning experience for me. I also got to meet a lot of cool people and I enjoy what I do overall.   </p>

    <h3>Moving Upwards</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>I eventually moved to a different store in search of more hours and I was so glad I did. I ended up staying at that store for a year until I moved stores again to where I am at now. I moved stores again to become an assitant produce manager. This job entails more than just cutting produce, and now I am learning plenty more compared to before. Now, I assist with unloading trucks and I order for the trucks and I have learned how to properly take care of produce. I really would like ot become a produce manager one day and from the way things are going, I am sure it will be sooner rather than later.  </p>
